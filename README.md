# Human action recognition from accelerometer data - ARFF filtered data generator script


[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/440236015.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/440236015)


This is a MATLAB script for the conversion of raw accelerometer data from the PAAL ADL (v1.0 or v2.0) into a filtered ARFF file.

To download the raw data, please access our [Zenodo](zenodo.org) repositories:
* [Version 1.0](https://zenodo.org/record/4750904)
* [Version 2.0](https://zenodo.org/record/5785955)

If **using the data**, please cite our Data in Brief _(submitted)_ paper:
